Boilerplates and example projects. There are skeletons in the closet

## Conventions
The skeleton projcts all should work out of the box. They are given a
descriptive name based on what they contain. The number at the end of them gives
an idea of how "complex" the boilerplate is. For instance, a "0" means it was
kept as simple as possible just to get a "hello world" to production.

I hope that this will give intuition about how projects should be laid out as
they grow.
